# Mediator Design Pattern
## Overview
The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling among a group of objects by centralizing their communication through a mediator object. Instead of each object directly interacting with other objects, they communicate through the mediator, which helps reduce dependencies and simplifies the system's interactions. This pattern is useful in scenarios where complex communication and coordination among objects are required.
## Participants
- Mediator: This is an interface or an abstract class that defines the communication protocol between colleagues. It usually includes methods for colleagues to register, send messages, and receive messages.
- ConcreteMediator: This is a concrete implementation of the Mediator interface. It maintains a list of registered colleagues and manages the communication between them.
- Colleague: This is an interface or an abstract class that defines the interface for interacting with the Mediator. Colleagues are the objects that need to communicate with each other but do so indirectly through the Mediator.
- ConcreteColleague: These are concrete implementations of the Colleague interface. They are aware of the Mediator and use it to send and receive messages to/from other colleagues.
## When to Use the Mediator Pattern
- When you want to decouple a group of objects, reducing direct dependencies between them.
- When you have a complex system where objects need to communicate and collaborate, but direct communication between them would be too chaotic and hard to maintain.
- When you want to centralize control over the interactions between objects.
- When you want to reuse individual components more easily in different contexts.
## Benefits
- Reduced Coupling: The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects since they don't need to know about each other's existence. They only need to be aware of the Mediator.
- Centralized Control: All communication and coordination logic are centralized within the Mediator, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- Flexibility: It's easier to introduce new colleagues or change how they interact since the Mediator handles the communication.
