# Singleton Design Pattern Sample
This is a simple C++ implementation of the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
# How to Use
## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have the necessary files: "singleton.hpp" and "singleton.cpp".
## Building the Program
- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the "singleton.cpp" file.
- Compile the program using your C++ compiler.
# Notes
 The Singleton pattern is used when there should be exactly one instance of a class in the program, such as in a configuration manager, logger, or database connection.
 Keep in mind that the Singleton pattern is often considered a design pattern anti-pattern, and it should be used judiciously, as it introduces global state and can make testing and maintenance more challenging.
