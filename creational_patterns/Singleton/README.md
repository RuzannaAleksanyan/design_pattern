# notes
 The Singleton pattern is used when there should be exactly one instance of a class in the program, such as in a configuration manager, logger, or database connection.
 Keep in mind that the Singleton pattern is often considered a design pattern anti-pattern, and it should be used judiciously, as it introduces global state and can make testing and maintenance more challenging.
