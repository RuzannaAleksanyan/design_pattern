## Introduction

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In this C++ program, we have an abstract `Product` class representing the common interface for products, and concrete classes `ConcreteProduct1` and `ConcreteProduct2` that implement this interface.

The `Factory` class provides a static method `foo` that acts as a factory method for creating instances of the `Product` objects based on the provided input type.

## Features

- Demonstrates the Factory Design Pattern in C++.
- Creates instances of different products through a common interface.
